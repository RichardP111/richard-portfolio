# Richard Pu | Computer Engineering Portfolio

A showcase of high-performance software and hardware integration, featuring custom-built game engines, embedded systems, and hardware restoration projects.

## 🛠 Engineering Philosophy

My approach to engineering is centered on the integration of hardware and software systems. I am driven by a need to understand the entire technical stack, from low-level circuit design and PCB-level interactions to high-level application logic and system architecture.
